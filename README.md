# Word-Phrase-Alignment

The topic for our major project is “Word-Phrase Alignment”. The main objective of this project is to develop software tools and a scheme for building a word or phrase-aligned corpus of English and Hindi optimally using existing open resources.

This project aims to modify the current method of training deep learning models from sentence level to word/phrase level. The Current method of training deep learning model for translation uses parallel corpus (i.e. a parallel corpus is a set formed by a text and its translation) which is on a sentence level. But this method requires a very large corpus to train the model which makes it difficult to get expected results from a smaller set of data. So if we can convert the parallel corpus to word/phrase structure level it will be easier to train and get a better result from a deep learning model. So comparatively model will require a small-sized corpus for training, eventually, it will reduce the time to train a model, as the size of data is reduced. It will also give more human control over the traditional model.

The project is a part of research at the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, under Anusaarka Lab for their open-source machine translation tool. We are working on the possibility of automating the task of alignment of words/phrases of the translated sentence in order to map these words/phrases with the words/phrases with the same meaning in the source sentence.
